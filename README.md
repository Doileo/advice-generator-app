## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties, Flexbox for styling
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (ES6+ features such as async/await)
- Fetch API for handling external data
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels for interactive elements)

### What I learned

One key takeaway from this project was improving my understanding of async/await for handling API requests. I also learned how to set the aria-label attribute for better accessibility.

Hereâ€™s a snippet demonstrating the use of async/await in my API call:

```js
const fetchAdvice = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(apiUrl, { cache: "no-cache" });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
  }

  return (await response.json()).slip;
};
```

- Using await to handle asynchronous operations without .then().
- Adding { cache: "no-cache" } to ensure fresh data on each request.
- Handling API response errors gracefully by checking response.ok.

### Continued development

- Further improvements on handling API errors
- Enhancing accessibility features and UI responsiveness
- Experimenting with local storage to save previous advice history

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) - Helped in understanding how to work with `async/await` and error handling in API requests.
- [MDN Web Docs - ARIA Labels](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) - Used to improve accessibility by adding meaningful labels to interactive elements.
- [JavaScript.info - Async/Await](https://javascript.info/async-await) - A great explanation of how to use async functions effectively.
